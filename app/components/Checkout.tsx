// STRIPE: USING STRIPE OBJECT TO ACCESS PAYMENT API ‚≠êÔ∏è
// `loadStripe` function asynchronously loads Stripe.js & initializes a `Stripe`
// object. It takes your Stripe publishable API key as a parameter. The function
// returns a `Promise` which resolves with the Stripe object that allows you to
// interact with the stripe API. We create a instance of a Stripe object so that
// we can process payments in the application. `Elements` are individual & also
// customizable components that collect and validate user input. When creating a
// instance of `Elements` you can pass in `elements.Options` object to configure
// certain aspects of the `Elements` group.

// asynchronously load a Stripe.js script and initialize a Stripe object.

// Since environment variables are server-side constructs, they are not readily
// available on the client-side in a Next app. You can use `publicRuntimeConfig`
// object in the Next config file to expose certain environment variables to the
// client-side. Alternatively, you can also prefix the environment variable with
// `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to make them available in the client browser.

// This is a secure way to use variables that you need on the client side, but
// remember to never expose sensitive secrets this way. Stripe publishable key
// is safe to use in the browser, but your secret key should never be exposed.

// STRIPE: WHAT THIS COMPONENT DOES ‚≠êÔ∏è
// This component is responsible for loading the stripe library and initializing
// stripe elements for us and additionally it also creates a payment intent for

// new payment intent or updates a existing one. We use Zustand to manage state
// of the cart and what payment intent stage we are in.

  // client side on your application, Stipe uses the `clientSecret` as parameter
  // to invoke specific actions or functions in Stripe. Like confirming payment,

  // A payment intent is a object that represent your intent to collect payment.
  // It's typically associated with a single purchase or transaction, which may
  // include a batch of multiple items together. Use a effect to either create a
  // new payment intent or update a existing one when the component mounts. This
  // allows customers to change their minds about an order before they pay. For
  // they can add/remove items from their cart. Keep in mind, that if the total
  // amount changes due to changes in the cart, the `PaymentIntent` will need to
  // be updated. In example the `paymentIntent` is managed in a Zustand store.

  // STRIPE: PAYMENT INTENT VS ORDER ‚≠êÔ∏è
