// We create a webhook endpoint to listen for events from Stripe `api/webhooks`
// Stripe CLI allows us to test webhook locally running: `stripe listen` & then
// forwarding to `--forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks`. We can also use the
// Stripe dashboard to test webhooks. Once our order is pending, our hook ü™ù is
// triggered & updates us when the order status is "complete".

  // EXPLAIN BUFFER AND STRIPE SIGNATURE ‚≠êÔ∏è
  // A 'buffer' method from 'micro' library to get the raw body of the request.
  // This is necessary because Stripe sends event data in the `body` in its raw
  // form, and also sends a 'stripe-signature' in the headers. The signature is
  // used when payload generated has our webhook's signing secret. Both the raw
  // body & signature verify that the events are sent by Stripe.
  const buf = await buffer(req);
  // When Stripe sends your server a webhook event, it includes a signature in
  // the `Stripe-Signature` header. This signature is created by using a secret
  // (webhook endpoint signing secret) to sign the payload (raw HTTP body). This
  // signature allows your server to verify a event was indeed sent by Stripe.
  const sig = req.headers['stripe-signature'];

  // STRIPE: VERIFYING WEBHOOK EVENTS ‚≠êÔ∏è

  // The event object contains all necessary info about what just happened, i.e.
  // including the type of event and the data associated with the event.
  let event: Stripe.Event;
  // The 'try-catch' block is used to handle any errors that might occur when we
  // call 'stripe.webhooks.constructEvent'. It "constructs" a event object from
  // a raw HTTP body `buffer`, a signature header, and a secret. Its mainly used
  // in the context of receiving and verifying "webhook" events from Stripe. It
  // takes three arguments: 1) payload: A raw HTTP body of the request. Usually
  // obtained by reading the incoming HTTP request's body raw not parsed into a
  // JS object. 2) header: The contents of the Stripe-Signature header from the
  // incoming HTTP request. `constructEvent` returns the parsed event object if
  // the signature verification passes, meaning the event can be trusted!

    // Here a charge was just made at Stripe and it succeeded. In this case, we
    // update the corresponding order in our db from "pending" to "complete". We
    // use the `where` argument from Prisma to find the order by its payment ID.
    // We use the extracted `charge` object to get the payment intent ID, which
    // is the same as the payment intent ID we stored in our db when we created
    // the order. We use the `update` method to update the order status.

  // of the webhook event. Importantly, because Stripe will continue to attempt
  // delivery for up to 3 days & if it doesn't receive a success response (HTTP
  // status codes 200-299). By sending response, we're letting Stripe know that
  // we successfully received the event so it doesn't need to continue retrying.
  // Note: this doesn't necessarily mean we've fully processed the event. If the
  // event's processing is time-consuming, consider handling it async to ensure
  // this acknowledgement is sent back to Stripe promptly.
