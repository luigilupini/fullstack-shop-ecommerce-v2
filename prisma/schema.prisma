// PRISMA: CREATE FOLDER STRUCTURE MANUALLY ‚≠êÔ∏è
// Instead of running the `npx prisma init` command, you can create the folder
// structure manually. This might be useful if you want more control over the 
// initialization process. Within your project root, create a new folder named 
// 'prisma' and within it, create a new file called `schema.prisma`.

// PRISMA: DEFINE YOUR DATA SOURCE AND GENERATOR ‚≠êÔ∏è
// In the `schema.prisma` file, define your data source and generator, as well
// as your database models. The 'datasource' block configures the connection to
// your database and the 'generator' block tells Prisma to generate a client
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql" // Specifies the database provider (e.g., postgresql, mysql, sqlite, sqlserver).
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL") // Connection URL to the database, stored as an environment variable for security.
}

// A 'generator' tells Prisma to generate a client for a specified language.
// Specifies the client language (in this case, JavaScript).
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

// PRISMA: DEFINE YOUR DATABASE MODELS ‚≠êÔ∏è
// Define your database models in the 'model' block. Models in Prisma correspond
// to tables in your database. Each field within a model, represents a column in
// the database table. Relationships between models (one-to-one, one-to-many) we 
// can define as well (see below).
model Todo {
  // 'id' field is unique and defaults to a cuid when a new Todo is created.
  id          String  @unique @default(cuid())
  title       String
  description String? // The '?' denotes this field as optional.
}

// PRISMA: SYNC YOUR MODELS WITH THE DATABASE (MIGRATE) ‚≠êÔ∏è
// To sync your models with the database (i.e., create the database tables), run
// `npx prisma migrate dev` command in your terminal. This generates & executes
// the necessary SQL migration files. Remember `DATABASE_URL` is and environment
// variable that should point to your actual database hosted in this case on an
// online service like railway.app üöÉ.
